# find failed connection attempts.sh begins on the previous line
#
# This macro searchs a packet trace looking for connection attempts that
# failed. 

# Output is a table of failed connection attempts. The first column is the
# TCP stream number followed by the server-ip:server-port and
# client-ip:client-port. The 4th coloumn is an indicator of why the stream
# made it into the table.
#	RST - first response from the server is a ReSeT
#	CHA - first response from the server is a CHAllenge ACK
#	IMC - server just accepts and then IMmediately Closes the connection
#	SYN - the only response from the server is an ACK-SYN
#	NOS - there are NO tcp Segments from the server

# The presence or absense of an ACK-SYN is not enough to determine if a 
# connect attempt succeeded or not. It is possible that the ACK-SYN is not
# captured for some reason. Also if the listen backlog is filled it is
# possible that server will send a ACK-SYNs but then still not complete the
# 3-way-handshake and continue to retransmit ACk-SYNs. You also cannot just
# look for retransmitted SYNs. First a SYN may be retransmitted multiple
# times before being accepted. Second, if the server responds with an ICMP
# destination unreachable or a reset the SYN may not be retransmitted. 
# Also if the server responds with a challenge ACK instead of a ACK-SYN the
# client can send its own reset.

# A connection attempt is considered as succeded if the client sends a SYN and
# the server sends a segment with the PSH flag set since that means that the
# server has sent data. Also if the ACK number of the first ACK segment sent
# by the server with no other TCP flags set is < 65535. That is an arbitrary
# cut off but large enough that several segments could be dropped without
# changing the conclusion and small enough that the probability that it is a
# challenge ACK is small (0.000015259 (65535 / 4294967295)). Also if the
# server sends a FIN with an ACK number > 1 it means that it has ACKed
# something besides the SYN, note that this might be the FIN from the client
# but either way it is considered a succeeded connection. On the other hand if
# the server accepts the connection and then immediatelty sends a FIN the
# conection attempt is considered as failed. Technically this is not a failed
# TCP connection attempt but since the client application most likely reported
# an error it gets added to the list of failed connection attempts. 

# You can monitor the progress of the script by looking at
# /tmp/failed-connection-attempts-4. As each stream number with a SYN is
# processed the number is written to the -4 file.
#         tail -f /tmp/failed-connection-attempts-4 2>/dev/null
# is your friend. Note that if its a large file with just a few connection
# attempts -4 may not update very fast. Also 



# Version 1.0 April 2, 2017
# Version 1.1 April 3, 2017
#  Added scenario 7
# Version 1.2 April 9, 2017
#  Added labels to each TCP stream number indicating the scenario.
# Version 1.3 April 11, 2017
#  fixed bug that incorrectly identified valid connections as scenario 7
#  if there were more than 999 bytes ACKed by server.
# Version 1.4 April 13, 2017
#  Redid the internal logic, added scenario 8 and removed the "suspected"
#  list
# Version 1.5 April 14, 2017
#  Added scenario 9 and 10 added the suspected list back
# Version 2.0 April 16, 2017
#  Completelty rewritten, removed the scenarios in favor of a simpler approach
#  and removed the suspected list (again).
# Version 2.1 August 22, 2017
#  Added the server:port client:port columns to the output
