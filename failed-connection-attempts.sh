# find failed connection attempts.sh begins on the previous line
#
# This macro searchs a packet trace looking for connection attempts that
# failed. There are several scenarios
#   1. SYN failed to get any response and is retransmitted until timeout
#   2  SYN failed to get any response but is not retransmitted
#   3. response is an ICMP destination unreachable - may be the cause of no
#      retransmissions. This response is typically due to a firewall either
#      on the target host or in the network between client and the target host
#   4. response is a reset, probably because nothing is listening although it
#      could be a firewall.
#   5. Server responds with a SYN-ACK but doesn't actually complete the
#      3-way handshake, it ignores the client's ACK and continues to send
#      back a SYN-ACK. This is due to listen backlog overflow.
#   6. response is an ACK instead of a SYN-ACK beacuse of port reuse and the
#      the previous connection is in TIME-WAIT state.
#   7. If the connection fails because the SYN-ACK is not reaching the client we
#      can have the scenario where the client gives up retransmitting SYNs while the
#      server is still retransmitting SYN-ACKs. If the client then starts a new
#      connection using the same client port number we have the server responding to
#      the SYN with an ACK and then retransmitting the SYN-ACK.

# Note just because a TCP stream does not include a SYN-ACK doesn't mean the
# connection attempt failed. It is possible that the SYN-ACK is not captured
# for some reason.

# The first thing the macro does is find all streams with a SYN, if there is
# no SYN there is no connection attempt to fail. Then for each of those streams
# it looks for TCP segments from the server. If there are no packets from the
# server we are into scenarios 1, 2 or maybe 3. It then looks for segments
# from the server with the ACK bit and multiple different other flags, i.e. 
# ACK-PSH, ACK-RST, ACK-SYN or ACK-FIN. If there are segments with at least 2
# combinationsthe connection had to have been successful. If not the
# connection has failed -- maybe. If the only segment is a reset with or
# without the ACK flag set I am going to assume we are into scenario 4. If the
# only ACK segment is a ACK-SYN I am going to assume scenario 5. If the only
# thing is an ACK with no other flags set we are in scenario 6 maybe. It is
# possible that the ACK-SYN was dropped and the server is just ACKing data
# sent to it from the client and the trace was stopped before the client
# disconnected. These connections are marked as suspect.
#
# Output is 3 columns, the keyword scenario, the scenario index and then the TCP Stream # numbers of the failed connections. If there are suspect streams they following in a
# second table.
#
# One final note. This script will count as a valid connection a TCP stream
# with a ACK-SYN from the server followed by a ACK-FIN or an ACK-RST from 
# the server. This is a connection that is accepted at the TCP layer and
# immediately closed at the application layer. Clients may disagree with this
# conclusion.


# Version 1.0 April 2, 2017
# Version 1.1 April 3, 2017
#  Added scenario 7
# Version 1.2 April 9, 2017
#  Added labels to each TCP stream number indicating the scenario.
# Version 1.3 April 11, 2017
#  fixed bug that incorrectly identified valid connections as scenario 7
#  if there were more than 999 bytes ACKed by server.
